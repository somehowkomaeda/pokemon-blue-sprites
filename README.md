This repository hosts sprites that I am using for a non-commercial project.
All of these sprites were originally from the Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue games and are widely available on Pokemondb.net. 
All rights to the original designs belong to Nintendo, Game Freak, and The Pok√©mon Company.
I do not claim ownership of these sprites or designs. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at exiagain@gmail.com.
